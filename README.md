# Svrf Unity plugin

# Svrf C# SDK

Svrf's API allows you to supercharge your project or app with the first and largest search engine for immersive experiences. We make it simple for any developer to incorporate highly immersive experiences with all kinds of applications: virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality, mobile, and web. See our [Unity Quick Start Guide][] to get started!

## Features

__Simple Authentication__: Add Svrf API key to your Unity app in one click.

__Svrf API full access__: Our [C# Library][] is already included and integrated with the plugin, so you can start [searching][] and [getting trending media][] right now!

__Easy load 3D models__: You can load Svrf 3D models either in editor or in run-time.

__Occlusion handling__: If you're building face masks application, we can handle occlusion for you.

## Examples

The plugin has some examples in the `Examples` folder that you can play with. However, Svrf API key is left empty there, so you have to insert your own to make it work.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions of any kind including new features, bug fixes, and documentation improvements.  If it is a major change, please open an issue describing what you want to build so that we can discuss how to move forward. Otherwise, go ahead and open a pull request for minor changes such as typo fixes and one-liners.
